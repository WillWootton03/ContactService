When working with software traditional errors, are easy to find and easy to fix. However, its when a program has logic errors that leads to bugs is 
when problems occur. Testing is one of the most important steps to creating good sound software and should be treated as such. Tests should evaluate 
code and make sure no matter what happens that the intended purpose executes correctly.  

User needs are also important as they provide a basis of what the software should do, if you design software that disregards user needs then no one will
use the software. It is important to take notes and actively check with these notes to be sure you are on the right track to designing your system. Userâ€™s
needs may change which may require you to adapt your plan or system to these changing needs. 

When designing software it is important to ensure that the overall design sticks to the requirements laid out by users and product owners. Constantly 
checking to be sure your system works how it should through testing, and how the requirements say is the most important part of a system.
